# -IRWA-2021-final-project-part-4

To execute the app, first of all we need to create a virtual environment.
Once it is created, we need to install the following libraries:
  - Flask
  - Faker
  - Nltk
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Httpagentparser

When the environment is set, the app can be executed from a terminal in the root directory with the command
    
    python web_app.py
    
On the terminal, a localhost IP will be shown corresponding to the local server where the web application is being executed.
The application can be reached by accessing to the given IP and port
